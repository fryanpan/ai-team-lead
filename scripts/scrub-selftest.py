"""Non-vacuity test for the pre-push leak gate.

The gate's failure mode is not "it flags the wrong thing" — it is "it sees
nothing and exits 0." That happened here for weeks: the fleet registry path
went stale in a rename, `find_registry()` returned None, zero project names
compiled, and every push passed the project-name check by not running it. The
hand-curated denylist kept the pattern list non-empty, so the one guard that
existed never fired.

A scanner whose only assertion is an absence proves nothing until you have
shown it can see a presence. So every case below plants something the scanner
MUST find, or asserts a specific refusal — and it runs against fixtures via
the SCRUB_REGISTRY / SCRUB_DENYLIST overrides, so it works identically on a
laptop with the real fleet config and on a CI runner with none of it.

Run: python3 scripts/scrub-selftest.py    (exit 0 = gate is alive)

    re-initializes the repo GIT_DIR names, and because the cwd isn't that
